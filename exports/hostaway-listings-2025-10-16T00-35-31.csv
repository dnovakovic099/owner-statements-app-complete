 🔔 OTHER THINGS TO NOTE 🔔

📌 We use ChargeAutomation to provide a secure guest portal, which can be shared with your group and adds an extra layer of verification to prevent fraudulent bookings. You'll receive this link after your booking is confirmed.

📌 We hold a security deposit during your stay, which will be fully refunded after check-out, provided there are no damages to the property.

📌 Please take a moment to read our House Rules in the House Rules section.

📌 This property comfortably accommodates up to 30 guests, but we are happy to consider hosting up to 40 guests if needed.

📌 Pool heating is available for an additional fee. To have the pool ready and warm for your arrival, please give us at least 48 hours’ notice.

📌  We’d like to set your expectations that the pool temperature is affected by the weather. On cooler days, the heating system may not be able to warm the water as much, but we’ll do our best to maintain a comfortable temperature for swimming.

📌  Since the property is secluded, we utilize an open trailer toward the front of the parking area of the property to hold waste. This is routinely emptied and disposed of. No unapproved events or groups larger than booked can be brought as this can overwhelm the septic tank system or well water system that is on the property.

📌 We offer options for early check-in and late check-out, subject to availability. Please note, there is a fee for early check-in and late check-out.

📌 Mid-stay cleaning and other concierge services are available upon request for an additional fee.

📌 For guests’ convenience, those with early arrivals or late departures can drop off their luggage with host approval before standard check-in time.

📌 We’re delighted to welcome you to our beautiful property, located near a body of water. To ensure a comfortable stay, we conduct weekly pest control to minimize the presence of no-see-ums, mosquitoes, and other insects. However, please note that being near water means there is a higher chance of encountering wildlife, including alligators, which can be found in any freshwater area in Florida. While this is part of the natural charm of the area, we encourage guests to enjoy the surroundings responsibly. Your comfort and safety are always our priority!

📌 Surveillance or recording devices on property - We use a noise monitoring device; It does NOT record actual sounds or conversations, it simply monitors the noise level (measured in decibels). Video recording devices only monitor the exterior of the home and not any of the interior or swimming/hot tub areas.","","10","","","550","",""

🌟 Such a peaceful place to stay! I loved being surrounded by nature 🌟

🏊 The outdoor space is really the key to why you’ll love this place! In the backyard we have a BBQ grill, a fire pit, a large pool, a shaded picnic area, and a raised gazebo - right on charming Lake Seminole!

🥂 The gazebo offers picturesque views of the lake and the entire backyard, perfect for cool drinks and catching up - while keeping an eye on the smaller vacationers playing in the pool.

🌳 Beside the gazebo there’s a lovely picnic area under the shade of a large banyan tree where you can watch the boats drift by. At the other edge, you’ll find the fire pit. Bring some firewood and s’mores to fully utilize this spot, or appreciate it as it is under the swaying palm trees.

📌 Note: Pool heating is available for an additional fee.

⭐ ACTIVITIES/ATTRACTIONS ⭐

📍 Looking for a beach day? Just head west! We are centrally located to many beaches, including Madeira Beach and Indian Rocks Beach. We recommend starting the day at Sweet Brewnette with a delicious specialty coffee and breakfast before soaking up the sun with your toes in the sand. Later, you can head to Caddy’s or John’s Pass for that quintessential Florida vacation vibe. John’s Pass offers a wide variety of excursions such as dolphin tours and jet ski rentals!

📍 Looking for something more off-the-beaten path? We highly recommend a guided kayak tour of Shell Key. This was awarded one of TripAdvisor's 2022 Best of the Best experiences IN. THE. WORLD. We personally loved Capt Yak (.net!) – they can even arrange private or sunset tours!

With large trees to nap under, a peaceful breeze to listen to as it whispers through the trees, and a porch as big as Texans’ hearts, the Farrington Farmhouse is sure to bring you serenity! You can watch the livestock roam, sip coffee on the porch swing, or catch up on your favorite shows with our Smart TV. 🌟 Come kick off your boots and stay a while! The sun rises and sets over a pasture of cows in the same spectacular way you see in the movies or hear written about in a country song. Only difference this time is, it’s real—and you can soak it in while sipping coffee or tea from the coffee bar, swinging to the good morning crow of the roosters. Once the sun is up, you have a kitchen full of appliances, utensils, dry goods, and spices to fix every meal. There is room for everyone around the tables and plenty of serving space. Smart TVs are in both living rooms to promote family time (Disney+, Netflix, Peacock, and Amazon Prime are provided). Or find just the right game in the playroom. Even better, set up Foursquare volleyball, bags (corn hole), or frisbee outside. When it’s time to start winding down the evening, light a fire in the fire pit for everyone to sit around. As the sun sets, be on the lookout for the moon and stars to bring your day full circle, experience a day like you see in a western movie, out at the Farrington Ranch.

Pets Policy:

To help us keep the space fresh for everyone, we also ask for a $250 refundable deposit for housekeeping and potential pet-related damage.

Shared Amenities & Local Perks:

While the building itself is private, guests are welcome to request exclusive add-ons through our À La Carte Services, including:

- Day passes to luxury pools or lounges at nearby hotels like Twelve Midtown, W Atlanta, The Starling, and more
- Event or Romantic Decor Setup - Give your significant other a time to remember.

Please inquire about availability after booking—these services are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and can be ordered through our app when you arrive or ahead of your visit by direct request via the platform app.

Guests will be given a code to enter the building and rental unit at the time of booking in the welcome letter, and a reminder message sent to the guest 60 minutes before the 4 PM check-in time.

We are always available. Please reach out to us on the booking platform app.

BACKDOOR ACCESS: We ask that you don’t use the door in the back of the unit as it will trip an alarm. It is for emergencies ONLY.

SOUND: There is an upscale nightclub next door.  Sound is low-level base, but no voices. The lounge is open from Fri-Sun 12 PM - 3 AM, and noise doesn't start until dark. If you are sound sensitive, please consider this before booking.

FRONT DOOR:  If the door gives you a hard time locking or unlocking:

- Gently pull the door toward you while turning the lock.
- Sometimes the door shifts slightly in the frame, and this will help the mechanism align properly.

TOILET:  For a full flush, please hold down the flush handle for at least 10 seconds. This ensures everything clears completely and prevents clogs.

SHORT-TERM EXTENSION TO A MONTH: For any guest booking with an initial duration of less than one month, if the guest wishes to extend their stay beyond one month, the Host requires the creation of a new booking rather than altering the existing reservation. Each subsequent monthly extension will also require a new booking. Guests extending their stay beyond one month must also schedule a housekeeping visit within the first week of each new monthly booking.

MID-TERM EXTENSIONS: For bookings exceeding 35 nights, a mid-stay cleaning fee will be applied and collected through the platform resolution center monthly. This is necessary to maintain the property in the advertised condition. The mid-stay cleaning includes housekeeping for all the bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and living room. Host-provided color linens are the guests' responsibility to launder, but our team will make the beds if the linens have been washed before our housekeeping team's arrival. The cleaning can be scheduled at your convenience, and your presence is not required for it to take place.

Lux Experience Corp conducts regular pest control treatments, but this doesn’t eliminate the possibility of them entering the property.","","11","","","140","",""
